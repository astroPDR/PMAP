PDR Method Automated Pipeline

After you found this repository, you may download the full source by clicking the "Download ZIP" button.
At this time, the pipeline needs to be run directly from source.

The following Python libraries should be installed:
numpy, scipy, astropy [*incomplete*]

To create a basic configuration file that can be filled out easily, run "python PMAP.py -c configFile".
To run the pipeline using the configuration file configFile, run "python PMAP.py configFile".

To complete the sample configuration file, one will need basic data of the galaxy to be processed,
such as its location, position angle, inclination, distance, foreground extinction (e.g. from NED).
Additionally, a dust model is required - for example a metallicity gradient or a metallicity map (FITS).

The minimum files necessary to run the pipline are:
- HI column density map (FITS, e.g. from THINGS)
- FUV flux map (FITS, e.g. from GALEX)

The pipeline produces csv files and vo-tables.
